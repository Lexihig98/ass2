        <h2>Who am I?</h2>

        <p> Hi there, my name is <span id="highlighted">Lexi Hignell</span> . I was born and raised in the <span
                class="highlighted">Comox Valley</span>, I quite like it here but I've
            definitely taken my chance to go live elsewhere.
            I left home the first time and moved to Whistler at 17 years old. That only lasted three months. A couple
            years
            later was searching for employment in Victoria. I ended up getting
            a job I had always wanted. Working as a Legal assitant at Notarys on Douglas. About a years time goes by and
            I end
            up sick of the city and I moved home. </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Web Experience </h2>
        <p>Although you may be able to tell, I dont have much experience at all with coding or any sort of graphic
            design.
            Before signing up for this course I did watch small tutorial videos as somewhat of an introductory
            to html. I managed to make a website similar to this one. Thats about as far as my experience goes. If you
            have any
            tips feel free to Email me at <a href="mailto:lhignell@northislandcollege.ca">lhignell@northislandcollege.ca
            </a> </p>

    <h2> Do I know any coding languages? </h2>
    <p style="color: #336633;"> I do not know any coding languages at this point in time, but check back by the end of this course, and bet you
        I will!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> What are my expectations from this course?</h2>
    <p style="color: #663366;">What I expect to learn in this course is the basics of <em>HTML </em>, and how to fully understand it and be able
        to
        put it all together to create web sites. </p>
