      <div id="main-content" > <h2>Who am I?</h2> 
       <p>Hi there, my name is Lexi Hignell. I was born and raised in the Comox Valley, I quite like it here but I've
        definitely taken my chance to go live elsewhere on the island.
        I left home the first time and moved to Whistler at 17 years old. That only lasted three months. A couple years
        later was searching for employment in Victoria. I ended up getting
        a job I had always wanted. Working as a Legal assitant at Notarys on Douglas. About a years time goes by and I end
        up sick of the city and I moved home. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> Web Experience </h2>
        <p>Although you may be able to tell, I dont have much experience at all with coding or any sort of graphic design.
        Before signing up for this course I did watch small tutorial videos as somewhat of an introductory
        to html. I managed to make a website similar to this one. Thats about as far as my experience goes. If you have any
        tips feel free to Email me at <a href="mailto:lhignell@northislandcollege.ca">lhignell@northislandcollege.ca </a> </p>
        </div id="main-content">
        <br>
        <br>
      <div id="lower content"> <h2> Do I know any coding languages? </h2>
     <p>  I do not know any coding languages at this point in time, but check back by the end of this course, and bet you I
        will!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> What are my expectations from this course?</h2>
       <p>What I expect to learn in this course is the basics of <em>HTML </em>, and how to fully understand it and be able to
        put it all together to create web sites. </p>
