        <h2>8 Tips for Using Images in Website Design</h2>
    <p>Images are a great addition to any site. They help break up the text on your site and give visitors a visual
        description of the content on the page. Images are a great opportunity to add value to your content and really
        engage your audience.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your images are relevant to the page's content.</li>
        <li>Optimize the image file sizes so that they aren't too big.</li>
        <li>Always include alt attributes and meaningful file names.</li>
        <li>Never use images to communicate anything that could easily be said with text.</li>
        <li>Use images to visually break up large areas of text to make it less intimidating.</li>
        <li>Select photos that look authentic, not like models posing for a stock photo.</li>
        <li>Try using icons to provide visual cues and explain the content.</li>
        <li>Always make sure you have the right to use the images legally.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don’t just use images for the sake of using images. Use images for a greater purpose beyond
        filling up white space or making a web page more visually interesting. With a little forethought and
        consideration, images can be a powerful type of content that will enhance the user’s experience on your website.
